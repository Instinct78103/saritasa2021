Our development team built the Proof-of-Concept for a virtual pre-trip vehicle inspection in Unity for the HTC Vive Cosmos. The purpose of the experience is to test prospective truck drivers on their ability to identify potential problems pre-trip. There’s a total of 14 items that applicants can interact with, with 7 correct choices and 7 incorrect choices.


[title]Timed Testing Experience[/title]
The tests have a 25-minute limit to complete. In order to avoid having a distracting timer counting down in the corner of the experience, we added a virtual watch that counts down the minutes. The watch is also how an applicant can end the test by selecting and holding the watch. The holding functionality is required so that users do not accidentally end the tests early.


[title]Unique Navigation[/title]
Applicants can navigate the experience via teleporting or using the joystick on the controller to “walk”. The tricky part of developing the navigation was ensuring that the user is always facing the truck without needing to turn around in real life.


[title]Secure Scoring[/title]
The results of the test are password-protected so that only approved personnel can view the scores and video recordings. The goal of the experience was to create a test that is as seamless as possible for both the proctors and the examinees.","Our team worked with the City of LA to build a virtual reality(VR) experience that allows them to more easily test truck drivers on a range of different pre-trip vehicle inspection points. A virtual reality experience minimizes costs and resources associated with testing. With a VR headset, the tests could be conducted anywhere and do not need to be scheduled for only large groups of applicants. 

Saritasa worked with the City of LA to create a proof of concept of the pre-trip vehicle inspection to help prove how virtual reality can be used as an innovative and efficient assessment tool.",,,,,The City of Los Angeles is responsible for the testing of truck drivers in order to qualify for many different job positions. These tests take a lot of time and resources including getting vehicles from the garage to a test site. The tests need to be scheduled for specific days at physical testing locations in order to test large groups all at once for efficiency. The virtual exam also allows for more efficient grading since it is captured on video for centralized scoring at any time.,,,false,,,,false,,,,,

Our team developed a Windows desktop application that aggregate the information from the heart rate bands and displays the data in easy-to-understand graphs. The desktop app was built using .NET and supports both online and offline functionality.


Firmware Development
A separate dongle receives a signal from the heart rate bands and records the data, which is then passed on to the desktop app. Multiple heart rate bands can connect to a single dongle, resulting in multiple devices with different components, limitations, and range. Our development team worked to identify and solve these challenges in order to quickly and accurate transmit the data.


Real-Time Data
Immersion is measured second-by-second through the hundreds of signals collected by the heart rate band in real-time. The data is viewable anywhere in the world, by any team member, the through web interface.


Immersion Quotient™ (inQ)
inQ accurately predicts what people want based on measuring data coming from the brain and captured through the heart with 82%-95% accuracy. It can predict the impact of experiences including purchases, social shares, brand loyalty, and engagement.","The Immersion Neuroscience Platform uses a heart rate monitoring band to track a participant’s physical response to an experience in order to calculate their level of engagement using their proprietary Immersion Quotient™. The technology measures the wearer’s unconscious emotional responses that reveal information about what people really want, with a high level of accuracy. 

In the case study referenced above, using two neurologic measures, Immersion Neuroscience was able to identify the top-rated shows with 84% accuracy, compared to the self-reported 17%.",ImmersionNeuroscience_screenshots.png,,,,"In a study by Immersion Neuroscience, they asked a group of people which shows from a group of 25 different shows from 6 major U.S. cable TV channels they would watch, in order to predict which shows would be the most successful. Based on their responses of the shows they intended to what, they predicted the top-rated shows with only 17% accuracy. This means that having consumers self-report their reactions to a show is an unreliable way to predict ratings. 

This is just one example of many case studies that Immersion Neuroscience has done to show that self-reporting has a bias and is often incorrect or unreliable. They believed there was a better way, a more accurate way, to measure the value of experiences. And thus, the Immersion Neuroscience Platform what born.",,,false,,,,false,,,,,

The virtual experience was built in Unity and optimized to work with the Oculus Quest. The Quest is an untethered VR headset, so it does not need to be connected to a computer to run. Because of this, it was critical for our team to optimize the experience to run with the constraints of the Quest in mind.


Unique Navigation
Our team created a navigation system that allows a user to view and interact with the entire 360-degree model without having to move. This allows a viewer to see the entire switch within a confined space, such as a tradeshow floor.

We were able to go from concept to delivery in 3 weeks by using pre-existing Unity assets for the artwork and the dedication of our team to work around the clock for a fantastic product.

Virtual Reality Development

Using a combination of Unity and Steam VR SDKs, our development team was able to quickly construct the realistic earthquake experience for the HTC Vive.

Interactive Experience 

The experience itself contains objects that fall down and break from the “shaking” of the earthquake. Users are directed to follow a 7 point checklist of preparedness instructions. In order to “survive” the earthquake, the user is instructed to crawl under a VR table for protection.

OnSite Support

We sent a couple members of our team to Wango Tango with iHeartRadio in order to ensure the VR experience functioned smoothly — aiding in set up (including tarps to shield the HTC Vive sensor’s from the sunlight’s interference), support during the event, and take down — providing an overall successful project.

A B2B module was developed to allow RxPrep’s business clients to open accounts and form their own privately controlled groups. Employers and schools can import student lists, grant students access to predetermined content, and create customized tests for their students using RxPrep’s content.

Cross-Platform Application Development

The mobile application was built to provide end users with a cohesive and universal product experience on their platform of choice whether desktops, Android, or iOS devices.

Account Management Tool

A complex account management tool was built integrated with the RxPrep CMS to allow very granular, secure access for end users.

Portable Offline Access

Our developers integrated offline content access into the mobile app to allow for offline video playback and content downloads increasing usability and demand for RxPrep products.

Content Management System (CMS)

A custom, scalable CMS was developed to provide efficient workflow solutions for website content management for the RxPrep team.

Amazon Fulfillment Center Integration

The RxPrep custom built eCommerce store is fully integrated with Amazon to facilitate secure product sales, fulfillment, and tracking.

Disabled Double Logins

To protect both RxPrep’s business model and their customers, double logins are disabled to prevent users from sharing login credentials.

Self-Healing Cloud Infrastructure

Saritasa built a self-healing cloud infrastructure (H/A, F/T) on Amazon AWS to detect when there are server operation errors or excessive load due to high traffic resulting in bigger latency. Necessary adjustments are made automatically to restore system performance/latency, saving RxPrep both time and money on maintenance.

Streaming on Desktop & Mobile Devices

Intelligent solutions were implemented to allow RxPrep administrators to manage and publish video content on demand and without the need for technical knowledge. The RxPrep videos were transcoded and segmented to different audio/video codes supported by different operating systems. Videos were also deployed in the content delivery network for faster access. Currently, RxPrep streams video to iOS, Android, and web devices utilizing HLS, RTMP, RTSP protocols.","Saritasa developed the RxPrep Student Learning Portals, eCommerce Site, and Mobile Applications for Android and iOS devices.",RxPrep_screenshots.png,,,,"RxPrep is a top rated NAPLEX® Board Review preparation program, offering pharmacy students worldwide top-level review courses and practice testing modules for all licensure exams in the industry.

As experts in Objective C programming, Apple’s native language for iOS development, our development team delivered a finished 5Clicks app that is both advanced in functionality and user-friendly. We worked through a collaborative effort with the client during the entire project; they provided designs and the API, and our team developed the application. Working from a consultative approach creates projects that run smoothly and a product solution that the client is very happy with.

API Integration

Before the iOS app was created, the client had an existing web application in place that operated similarly. Our developers integrated the existing API from the web application to the iOS app. With the client’s API already in place, our developers worked with the current UI (user interface) and design. They also assisted in programming the product specs, the shopping cart, and shipping information to flow smoothly and maintain secure information.

Textile Selections

Within in the application, a user can select the manufacturer, fabric application, furniture model, grade of fabric, length of fabric, and even the total number of furniture pieces they are shopping for. Once that information has been gathered, the SKUs are given to the user. SKU, or Stock Keeping Unit, is a way for manufacturers and vendors to manage an accurate count on what they have in their inventory. The pieces on hand that fit the description that was input by the user become visible as a thumbnail in the app. There is also a Refine Search option, with selections available in Type, Style, and Color. A strong benefit of the 5Clicks app is all fabrics are pre-approved, in stock and updated in real-time.","Our team of developers worked with Momentum Textiles to develop an image-rich application system that would allow their clients to search, browse and purchase with ease.",5Clicks_screenshots.png,,,,"In the fabric industry, a mobile application was needed to provide better methods of organizing and facilitating the purchasing of swatches from vendors and distributors nationwide.",Published,,false,,,,false,Tristan Guinto,zcrm_339855000054995092,,,

Using Intelligent Inventory & Ordering Systems, or IIO Systems, operators can determine the products they need to purchase. IIO is a revolutionary ordering system that assists restaurant and bar owners with accurate inventory orders every time! Saritasa’s skilled development team worked with IIO Web Systems to develop both the iPad app and the website for convenient inventory tracking and one-touch automated ordering.","Predictive Software Development: IIO Systems can analyze the patterns and quantities sold in the past to determine current ordering needs. Say a bar uses 50 ounces of tequila for margaritas in a given week. If the bar accounts for 40 ounces of tequila sold, IIO Systems creates a report showing the operator what was lost, providing vital information for future purchasing. Whether the bartenders are over-pouring or giving alcohol away, the IIO Systems application uses its’ Loss Prevention Tool to access how much of all product was lost. The IIO System not only calculates the alcohol needed for future drinks, but it also accounts for all other ingredients as well. The system uses predictive software to tell operators how much of the other ingredients needed to purchase for upcoming weeks. Saritasa developers built the app with advanced capabilities to integrate with any POS system in the industry. 

Drag & Drop Inventory Management: Using IIO Systems, operators are able to set the system up around their business instead of having to change their business structure to adapt to the system. With a drag and drop feature, operators can organize the IIO Systems program around their business, and with the handheld app, these actions can be performed on a mobile device. Using the app, any operator can enter the inventory on location and with ease. The predictive software accounts for historic data (how much has sold in a previous time frame), time of year, time of day, and even includes the weather. These factors can be implemented to adjust orders accordingly. Saritasa’s team of developers integrated the client’s API with the current system used. 

Programming Language & Design: Apple’s native language Objective C was used to design this iPad application.

Saritasa built the web app and the iOS app for Opoli, whose goal is to revamp the way people use applications for finding a taxi. Opoli was designed to connect the rider directly to the driver with ease.

Using the same service provider model as for transportation services, Opoli aims to become the go-to app for any service consumers may need; dog grooming, plumbing, or even having your valet parked.","Price Negotiation: With Opoli, consumers can create their own price points for transportation services. Users simply state their desired price point, and service providers (drivers) can respond by accepting or countering their offer. The unique benefit of this service is the consumer and the provider can negotiate a price before the service even begins. The iPhone application utilizes GPS functionality so local drivers can respond immediately to local requests. Drivers receive a summary of the requested ride along with the price the rider would like to pay. Ratings, images of providers and their cars and the respective offer amount appears on the customer’s iPhone on a map, so the customer has the information to make the best ride choice. 
Consumer & Driver iOS App: Opoli is primarily an iPhone app, but can be used on the iPad as well. Saritasa app developers built the iOS application for both the consumer and the provider using Objective-C, Apple’s native programming language. The user interface was designed to be user friendly for consumers with a clean, modern design. For drivers, the goal of the UI design was simply to be easy to use. In providing an app for both users and service providers, Opoli allows consumers to do business directly on their own terms. 
Web App Development: In addition to the iOS app, our development team built the Opoli web app as a widget on the Opoli website providing the same functionality as the consumer iPhone app. This way, users have the option to search for services through the website or through their iPhone app. PHP and MySQL was used in the database system development to accommodate the large data needs of Opoli. Node.JS development was utilized to ensure Opoli would be a fast and efficient network application.

— Ricky Olivarez, CEO Digital EMS Solutions Inc.","The Medic Clipboard iPad App enables first responders from the fire department to create Digitized Incident Reports out in the field. Our client, Digital EMS Solutions, Inc., has created a revolutionary ePCR software and application system that converts existing paper patient care report forms into a digital format without requiring first responders to learn a new program.

The Medic Clipboard iPad App requires iOS 5.0 and higher, and was developed by our iPad app development team on the open L.A.M.P. (Linux, Apache, mySQL and PHP) platform, using a combination of Objective C to optimize device capability and leveraging HTML5 features to deliver an innovative solution that can be customized to meet each fire department’s specific form presentation requirements.

Some departments currently using Medic Clipboard: Burbank Fire Department, Glendale Fire Department, Hermosa Beach Fire Department, Monterey Park Fire Department, Pasadena Fire Department, San Marino Fire Department, West Covina Fire Department","Viewable Reports: Embracing mobile technology is an important step in combating the current backlog of paperwork waiting for digital conversion, as mandated by the Electronic Medical Records initiative. The Medic Clipboard eliminates the paperwork that is time-consuming for the first responders to complete, and can be difficult for hospital staff to read. When the patient arrives at the hospital, the doctors and nurses have access to the same medical information as the emergency personnel, streamlining patient communication and interaction, and delivering a higher level of coordinated care. 
Client Management: Unlike service-as-software applications, the Medic Clipboard presents firefighters with an electronic display of the exact paper field form, which has dramatically reduced the amount of training time, because data entry is familiar and intuitive. Incorporating “hot spot” display techniques, the firefighters simply tap on the field to be completed, and a box pops out for data entry. Upon completion, the form is submitted for seamless integration into both the hospital’s and the fire department’s databases. 
Incidents Management: Digitized Incident Reports can also help in the reduction of errors, while offering improvements in efficiency and quality of care, by providing real-time access to, and integration of, information across the network of providers who share the responsibility of patient care.",,,,false,,,,false,,,,,

The driving force behind the concept of GoGoCabi is the idea that calling a third party dispatcher is an old-fashioned way of reaching a service provider in this digital age, especially when intuitive smartphones can track location, share appointment information, and send messages instantly in a seamless and effortless way.

Using the iPhone’s built-in GPS to determine users’ locations, the GoGoCabi iPhone App allows prospective passengers to hail participating cabs in their vicinity with just the push of a button. Once a passenger’s “hail” is sent out to nearby cabbies, cab drivers can deny or accept the hail. If accepting, the driver is promptly sent the new passenger’s contact information, a map of their location, and is also given the convenience of sending pre-written texts that inform the new client of their estimated time of arrival, request specifications for pickup location, explain unexpected delays, etc.

The GoGoCabi iPhone App is a win-win for both passengers and drivers. Those looking to catch a ride no longer have to suffer the pain of standing on street corners hoping to find cabs that never show up, and drivers have the opportunity to avoid driving long distances for free in order to pick up inconveniently-located commuters. Passengers also have the ability to schedule pickups in advance and at different locations just by changing the time and place options found on the application. Dedicated to making your cab hailing experience even more convenient, the GoGoCabi iPhone App also allows passengers to save their cab drivers to a favorites list, making it easy to call back favored cab drivers later.

The GoGoCabi iPhone App is designed so that users can register under three different parties—passengers, taxicabs, and business partners. Passengers are given the pleasure of using GoGoCabi’s services free of charge and are encouraged to use this application as often as they wish, while taxicab drivers are charged $1 per “hail” they accept but are given the benefit of having a major boost in business! Additionally, registered business partners are given the amazing chance to help boost cab availability while earning their own money as a result.

GoGoCabi is an exciting iPhone App not only because of the amazing services it provides, but because its popularity is already growing! The GoGoCabi iOS app is available for FREE download in iTunes with services offered in Los Angeles and San Francisco.",,,Published,,false,,,,false,,,,,

After feeling fed up with being constantly inundated by e-mails and PDF files, CritWalls was born. A team of designers and brand consultants developed the idea of a website service that could streamline the review process for visual creations. Inspired by the use of wall space to mount, display, and rearrange images while exchanging creative ideas during traditional, in-person meetings, the CritWalls website transfers this effective use of “the wall” to the virtual world, making long-distance collaboration as effective as on-site meetings without the expense and inconvenience.","Interactive Interface: No longer walled into the idea that collaborative business tools are limited to written text, CritWalls offers one centralized location for multiple parties to view, develop, and discuss designs and other visual creations in real-time. This unique service provides an interactive interface that lets users both upload their own image files (PSD, AI, PDF, JPG) and download colleagues’ files directly from the site, saving users the hassle of exchanging images through e-mail. 
Simple Markup Tools: Perhaps most impressive, however, is the ease in which users can post reviews, comments, and suggestions right onto the images themselves. Simple to use markup tools (such as the color wheel, drawing tool, eraser tool, and type tool) provide users the utility of arrows, circles, freehand drawings, and imbedded comment boxes to make critiques on the exact part of the image they wish to discuss; furthermore, future visitors to these images have the option of both viewing or hiding these comments at any time. For those not big on typing out reviews and suggestions, audio message recording is also available. 
Real-Time Comment & Discussion: CritWalls’s user-friendly dashboard provides a dual-purpose sidebar that displays real-time updates for all projects in progress and accommodates for a chat-structured wall discussion categorized by image and topic, making it easy for users to exchange ideas in a quick and effective way. The ability to comment on and discuss individual images in an organized manner is an important element of CritWalls as it enables designers and their clients to share feedback that is clear, well-organized, and immediately actionable.",,,,false,,,,false,,,,,

The 3D Sailboat Racing iPad App teaches essential sailing skills by illustrating the effects of wind shifts on the position and course of boats heading toward the windward mark and by including exercises that demonstrate upwind strategies for persistent and irregular wind shifts.
Multiple Navigational Perspectives: “The magic, of course, is in the 3D,” commented Nik Froehlich, President and CEO of Saritasa, while explaining the effectiveness of this application. Indeed, the third dimension is the key element in making the 3D Sailboat Racing iPad App an immersive and valuable training tool, allowing users to understand the tricky dynamics of sailing upwind by exploring these events first-hand. Creating a full 3D experience, Saritasa’s Sailboat Racing App constructs multiple navigational perspectives including aerial, third person, and cockpit points of view while also enabling figure gestures that can look up, down, and around a full 360 degrees. This on-the-boat, 3D simulation produces a realistic sense of the effects wind shifts have on sailboats, thus creating an interactive environment for learning how to harness this wind correctly to keep one’s boat on course. 
Practice Sailing Maneuvers: Wind shifts play a pivotal role in operating a destination-oriented sailboat, making the 3D Sailboat Racing iPad App an important tool for learning how to recognize, interpret, and respond to strong and rapid changes in wind direction. This application gives users the convenience of practicing sailing maneuvers on the readily available iPad app without the expense and hassle of practicing drills on the water, resulting in more thoroughly trained and competent skippers.",,,,false,,,,false,,,,,

Coaching staffs have the ability to add prospects and family members, log contact history, log evaluations, and add enrollment in a sport. Changes to any dated are updated in real time. The FieldLevel Team App includes live updates and push notifications. Because all recruiting activity is recorded with the FieldLevel Team App, compliance reports are easily generated, reducing paperwork.

Our team of developers built the PearPop platform as a web app using PHP and View.JS. Users can access it via a browser on their desktop or mobile, and it is optimized for mobile devices.


Custom Workflows
To work around the lack of APIs from TikTok, we helped PearPop build out a custom workflow where all users are manually checked by the PearPop team. Every time a new user registers on PearPop (using the same username as their TikTok), they are given a verification code to add to their TikTok bio. A PearPop team member will then verify the profile. The same method of verification is used to ensure video requests are honored by the PearPro.


Multiple Request Types
PearPros (aka TikTok influencers) are able to set a fixed price for “Duets”, “Stitches”, and “Sounds”. Users can also send a bid with the amount they would like to pay for either post type, and PearPros have the ability to either accept or reject the request.


Real-Time Notifications
PearPros are updated in real-time when they receive requests and can accept/decline requests at any time. Once a request is accepted (or rejected), the member that sent the request is updated and the PearPro has 24 hours to upload the video.


Secure Payment Integration
PearPro integrates with banks and credit cards via Stripe. Members are required to add their credit card information before they send any requests, and PearPros must set up their deposit information. The member’s credit card is not charged until a PearPop team member verifies that the video has been posted. Once it is verified, the card is charged and the PearPro gets access to the funds.


Scalable Platform
PearPop was built with scalability in mind. With how massive TikTok is, the platform needed to be architecture to handle a massive amount of users all sending and accepting requests at the same time. The platform is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) in order to ensure flexible scaling.",The idea was simple: allow TikTok users to pay influencers to “Duet” or “React” to their videos. Larger influencers are able to monetize their audience by being paid to create content for their fans and smaller influencers are able to pay larger influencers to promote their content. Fans are able to engage with their favorite accounts (aka PearPros) and get them to interact with their own content. It’s a win/win for everyone involved!,PearPop_screenshots.png,,,,"TikTok is a massive social media platform with over 800 million users worldwide (as of May 2020) and is valued at $75 billion (as of June 2020). It also has the highest rate of social media engagement per post across all platforms (including Instagram and Facebook). Engagement is a core part of TikTok’s platform, which allows users to “Duet” and “React” to other user’s videos. 

Creators have curated massive followings on TikTok, with the most popular account having over 40 million followers.

Our team of engineers built a Native iOS app using Swift to give users the optimal user experience. 

GPS Location
The idea behind the app is to connect with other couples in your area. It heavily relies on GPS integration. Parents can adjust their search radius based on their distance preferences.

Interest Filters 
Couples are able to add their interests to the app and filter by those interests. If they want to find fellow movie junkies, other couples who love board games, or active hikers, they can filter with the click of a button!

Matching System
Similar to most apps based on connecting their users, Couples Connect uses a mutual “liking” system. Parents are able to “like” other couples’ profiles, and if there’s a match, they get to exchange contact information.","Nowadays, there’s an app for everything. Enter, Couples Connect. 

Our client had the genius idea to build a platform that allows couples to connect with other couples in their area who have similar interests and similar-aged children. No more struggling to find friends in new areas or couples who enjoy similar activities! Now, you can connect with like-minded couples with a few taps on your phone.",CouplesConnect_screenshots.png,,,,"It can be hard to meet new friends after a big move, or even when you just want to expand your social circle.

The kiosk, web, and mobile apps were all built using the Python programming language. The web version was wrapped into both iOS and Android apps.

The VR experience begins in the same room as the season premier. Since the show takes place in London, the team chose three famous sights in the city to visit on the way to watch the premier at a London hotel - which is featured in the show as well.  The participant is taken to all three sights in a luxury car with a driver who narrates the tour.  Upon reaching the hotel, the participant is invited up to a room where the trailer and season 3 premier of “The Girlfriend Experience” can be viewed on a large screen.
Tight Timeline
From start to completion, the entire project took 6 weeks to build out. Timeline was a critical component of the project because the premier date had been set. The VR experience also needed to be pre-loaded onto 225 headsets and shipped out to individuals in the media world ahead of the premier. 
Hardware Constraints
Each participant of the premier needed to be sent a VR headset so we needed to find an affordable device that would still provide excellent visual quality and performance. The Pico Neo G2 4K headsets met that requirement, but came with the additional challenge of limited motion tracking. To counter the lack of forward and backward motion, we developed the entire experience to take place while seated. This meant we had to be creative about navigation and how visual elements were placed since the person would not have the ability to navigate by physically walking around.
Unity Development
Through our collaborative efforts, Starz and Saritasa created a first-of-its-kind TV premier, blending technology and media into an innovative virtual reality experience. The virtual reality premier experience was built in Unity. Future updates to the experience are able to be pushed out to the headsets wirelessly using a centralized management console.","The first episode of The Girlfriend Experience season 3 begins with the main character in virtual reality (VR). The team at Starz had the brilliant idea to tie in the experience of the main character with the experience of the premier by creating a VR screening of the first episode. When Starz reached out to Saritasa, they had an initial concept but no prior VR development experience. Our team worked closely with Starz to design and develop a one-of-a-kind immersive season premiere in virtual reality.",,,,,"The COVID-19 pandemic affected nearly every industry - including the entertainment industry.

Our team built two separate backend admin panels for the management of the system. A super admin oversees and controls the entire system, while a dispatch admin manages the jobs themselves. A dispatch agent is responsible for adding trips to the system, including; dates, drivers, trucks, start and end points, and any waypoints needed. 

Driver App
Once the trip is created, the driver will get a text notification and a link to the trip. The driver is then able to open a mobile-friendly web version of the system and add in their location and the amount of gas in their truck. Once the trip is calculated, the driver receives another text with their route mapped out.

3rd Party Integrations
The system is integrated with a map that tracks all the gas stations across the country. It also keeps track of the gas prices at each location. Our team built a way to import fuel prices from each location so the system always has the most up-to-date information.

When Merit came to us, they already had the base of the system developed. We ended up working off the original codebase and redeveloping the entire system over the years.

It tracks all the different types of activities that the workers do, from loading and unloading, picking up orders, managing inventory, and more. 

Facial Recognition
The system also integrated with facial recognition hardware at the entrance to the facilities. Employees scan their faces when they clock in and scan again when they clock out. The facial recognition eliminates any tracking errors that may come from dated employee cards and keeps time records down to the minute.

Our team built a custom warehouse environment that scales approximately 22,500 square feet, spanning both inside and outside the facility. This large warehouse contains both custom elements designed and built by our internal 3D design team, alongside optimized assets. The graphics were optimized to create as realistic an experience as possible.

Health & Safety Training
The goal of the experience is for trainees to identify Corrections in the warehouse. Corrections are items and/or areas that violate either a food safety code or may contribute to pest problems and need to be corrected. For example, if a pallet with allergens is in a non-allergen isle, it is a health hazard that needs to be corrected by moving the pallet. 

Real-Time Score Keeping
Once a trainee identifies a correction, they are given a multiple choice question asking how to correct the hazard. They are then told whether their answer was correct, and have a visual tally of their correct and incorrect responses along with a timer. A voice over explains the proper remediation strategy. The trainee’s goal is to identify as many Corrections and their remediations as they can within the time limit. 

Unity Development
The entire platform was built on Unity by our expert team of 3D designers and developers for the Pico Neo headset. The Pico Neo headset provided the optimal balance between affordability, flexibility and quality for the training experience.","Virtual reality provides powerful capabilities for companies looking to innovate and standardize their training. VR training has a retention rate of 75%, beating out lectures (5%), reading (10%), and audio-visual learning (20%) (FrontCore, 2020). With those kinds of results, it's no mystery as to why a company looking to improve their training would invest in VR. 

Saritasa worked closely with RK Environmental Services to design a virtual warehouse environment to train employees on identifying problem areas. The experience allows employees to learn about potential safety and pest hazards in a safe, yet immersive environment.",,,,,"RK Environmental Services provides pest management and food safety solutions to food, pharmaceutical, and related industries. They provide facility audits, pest management, inspection, and maintenance services to their clients, including top brands like Pepsico. 

RKE’s success has come from their commitment to provide unmatched customer service backed by their three-decades of experience and expert knowledge. As the company grows, they need a reliable, replicable way to onboard new employees but maintain the same quality standard of training. Always on the cutting edge, RKE began researching ways technology could help improve their training.",Needs Design,,true,,2021-09-21,2021-09-21,true,Danny Feldman,zcrm_339855000038277001,Dan Kenton,zcrm_339855000012000495,zcrm_339855000042702159
